Several of San Francisco's parks and nearly all of its beaches form part of the regional Golden Gate National Recreation Area, 
one of the most visited units of the National Park system in the United States with over 13 million visitors a year. Among the
 GGNRA's attractions within the city are Ocean Beach, which runs along the Pacific Ocean shoreline and is frequented by a vibrant 
 surfing community, and Baker Beach, which is located in a cove west of the Golden Gate and part of the Presidio, a former military base. 
 Also within the Presidio is Crissy Field, a former airfield that was restored to its natural salt marsh ecosystem. The GGNRA also administers 
 Fort Funston, Lands End, Fort Mason, and Alcatraz. The National Park Service separately administers the San Francisco Maritime National Historical 
 Park â€“ a fleet of historic ships and waterfront property around Aquatic Park.
